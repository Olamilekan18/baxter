      "content": "#### What you will learn\n• The four habits shared by elite investors.\n• How diversification, compounding, and psychology work together.\n• A simple blueprint for creating your own lifetime investing plan.\n\n#### Key concepts explained\n1. **Pay-yourself-first** – Treat investing as a non-negotiable bill. Automate transfers the morning your salary arrives so saving is effortless.\n2. **Emergency fund first** – Park 3–6 months of expenses in a high-yield account to avoid panic-selling when life happens.\n3. **Asset allocation** – Split money between equities, bonds, and cash using an age-based glide path (e.g., 110 − your age = % in stocks).\n4. **Time in the market > timing the market** – Missing just the 10 best trading days per decade typically halves total returns.\n\n#### Step-by-step blueprint\n1. Open a low-cost brokerage and a separate savings account.\n2. Calculate your “investable surplus” (income − essential bills − emergency fund contribution).\n3. Set up an automatic monthly purchase into a broad index ETF (e.g., S&P 500) and a local-market fund for geographic balance.\n4. Rebalance annually: sell overweight winners, buy laggards to restore target percentages.\n5. Review goals each January—then ignore day-to-day noise.\n\n#### Real-world case study\nWarren Buffett’s 1988 Coca-Cola buy: \$1 billion turned into \$20 billion+ by 2025—almost entirely through reinvested dividends and patient holding.\n\n#### Activity\nWrite your own one-page “Investment Policy Statement” covering risk tolerance, target allocation, and automatic contribution size. Share with a study buddy for accountability.\n\n#### Common pitfalls\n✘ Trading every headline.  \n✘ Concentrating in a single hot sector.  \n✘ Investing before building an emergency cushion.\n\n#### Takeaway\nElite investors are methodical, boring, and relentlessly long-term. Adopt their systems, not their stock picks."

      "content": "#### What you’ll learn\n• How inflation quietly erodes idle cash.  \n• The math of compound growth (Rule of 72).  \n• Historical returns of stocks vs. bonds vs. savings accounts.\n\n#### Key concepts explained\n1. **Inflation** – At 3 % inflation, ₦1 000 today buys only ₦744 worth of goods in 10 years. Investing must outpace this.\n2. **Compounding** – Earnings are reinvested so growth accelerates. The Rule of 72 estimates doubling time: 72 ÷ annual % return.\n3. **Opportunity cost** – Every naira left dormant forfeits potential gains.\n\n#### Historical perspective\n• Average annual real (after-inflation) return 1926-2024:  \n – U.S. stocks ~7 %  \n – Government bonds ~2 %  \n – Cash ~0 %  \nA long-term stock investor saw purchasing power quadruple every 20–25 years; a saver barely kept up.\n\n#### Worked example\nInvest ₦100 000 yearly at 8 %. Years to ₦10 million (future naira): ~18. Stop after the first five years and leave the money to grow: final pot halves to ~₦5 million—showing the cost of delaying.\n\n#### Interactive exercise\nOpen any compound-interest calculator and test how delaying by 5 or 10 years changes your results. Screenshot the graph for your notes.\n\n#### Common pitfalls\n✘ Confusing high nominal returns with high real returns (always subtract inflation).  \n✘ Thinking investing is “too risky” but ignoring the guaranteed loss of purchasing power in cash.\n\n#### Takeaway\nInvesting turns time into a money-making ally; procrastination turns it into your biggest expense."

Move a symbolic ₦500 into each to feel the system working.\n\n#### Pitfalls & fixes\n✘ Relying on memory; **fix:** automate.  \n✘ Forgetting to revisit percentages when income changes; **fix:** schedule a quarterly money date.\n\n#### Takeaway\nA clear, automated income system frees your brain for bigger investing decisions."

      "content": "#### What you’ll learn\n• The legal meaning of “share of ownership.”  \n• How common vs. preferred shares differ.  \n• Ways shareholders can earn returns.\n\n#### Share structure 101\n| Type | Rights | Typical Owners |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **Common** | Vote, potential dividends, last in liquidation | Public investors |\n| **Preferred** | No vote, fixed dividends, priority in liquidation | Institutions, income seekers |\n\n#### Rights embedded in a share\n1. **Voting** – Elect board members, approve mergers.  \n2. **Dividends** – Cash or stock payouts (not guaranteed).  \n3. **Residual claim** – Receive assets if the company is liquidated (after creditors).\n\n#### Order of claims in liquidation\nCreditors → Bondholders → Preferred → Common. Common shareholders therefore demand higher expected returns.\n\n#### Example: Apple Inc.\n• 16 billion diluted shares outstanding. Buying 1 share ≈ 0.000000006 % of Apple. Yet over 20 years, that sliver compounded 25 x in price plus dividends.\n\n#### Quiz\nTrue/False – A company must distribute profits as dividends. (False.)\n\n#### Takeaway\nOwning stock makes you a business partner, with the same exposure to both profits and pitfalls."

      "content": "#### What you’ll learn\n• How ETFs marry diversification with stock-like convenience.  \n• The mechanics of the creation-redemption process that keeps prices in line.  \n• Cost, tax, and liquidity considerations.\n\n#### Anatomy of an ETF\n1. **Basket** – Holds dozens to thousands of securities following an index (e.g., S&P 500) or theme (e.g., clean energy).  \n2. **Share** – Trades intraday on an exchange at market prices.  \n3. **Authorized Participants (APs)** – Large institutions that swap baskets for ETF shares, arbitraging away pricing gaps.\n\n#### Passive vs. active ETFs\n• **Passive** – Track an index; lower fees (often 0.03 %–0.10 %).  \n• **Active** – Portfolio manager aims to outperform; higher fees (0.5 %+), may have higher turnover.\n\n#### Tracking error\nSmall difference between ETF return and index return caused by fees, sampling, or cash drag. Look for < 0.2 % annually.\n\n#### Expense ratio impact\nPaying 1 % vs. 0.05 % on a ₦5 million portfolio over 30 years (8 % growth) costs ≈ ₦3 million in lost gains—nearly as much as your original investment!\n\n#### Activity\nCompare two ETFs that track the same index but charge different fees. Use an online calculator to estimate 20-year cost difference.\n\n#### Takeaway\nETFs give small investors instant diversification, but fees and liquidity require a quick check before clicking “buy.”"

      "content": "#### What you’ll learn\n• How exchanges, brokers, and clearinghouses interact.  \n• The flow of an order from your phone to the market.  \n• Key terms: bid, ask, spread, market maker.\n\n#### Market plumbing in 60 seconds\n1. Place a **market order** in your broker app.  \n2. Order routes to an exchange (e.g., NYSE).  \n3. A **market maker** matches your buy with someone’s sell and quotes two prices: **bid** (buy) and **ask** (sell).  \n4. After execution, the trade clears through a clearinghouse (DTCC) on **T+2** (moving to T+1 in 2025).\n\n#### Types of orders\n| Order | When to use |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Market | Immediate fill, price uncertainty |\n| Limit  | Control price, no guarantee of fill |\n| Stop-loss | Exit automatically if price drops below X |\n\n#### After-hours & pre-market\nLower liquidity widens spreads; beginners should stick to regular hours.\n\n#### Circuit breakers\nIf an index drops 7 %, 13 %, or 20 % in a single day, exchanges pause trading to calm panic.\n\n#### Activity\nLook up today’s bid-ask spread for two large-cap stocks and two thinly traded small-caps. Notice the cost of illiquidity.\n\n#### Takeaway\nThe stock market is a sophisticated but highly efficient auction. Understanding its mechanics helps you trade with confidence and lower costs."

      "content": "#### What you’ll learn\n• The purpose of indexes as economic thermometers.  \n• Different weighting schemes and how they affect performance.  \n• How index rebalancing works.\n\n#### Weighting methods\n| Method | Example | Quirk |\n|--------|---------|-------|\n| Market-cap | S&P 500 | Bigger companies dominate |\n| Price-weight | Dow Jones 30 | \$400 stock moves index more than \$40 stock |\n| Equal-weight | RSP ETF | Small stocks get same weight as giants |\n\n#### Rebalancing\nMost indexes revisit weights quarterly; some (e.g., Nasdaq-100) limit single-company weightings to maintain diversification.\n\n#### Using indexes\n1. **Benchmark** – Compare your portfolio to the S&P 500 or a local index.  \n2. **Invest** – Buy index funds/ETFs that replicate the basket.  \n3. **Trade derivatives** – Futures and options on indexes help hedge risk (advanced).\n\n#### Activity\nPick any index and list its top 10 holdings and percentages. How concentrated is it? Would you feel comfortable having 40 % in the top two names?\n\n#### Takeaway\nIndexes simplify market noise into a single number—but the recipe (weighting) changes the flavor of that number."

Board votes to pursue an IPO; hire investment banks as **underwriters**.  \n2. File an S-1 prospectus; disclose financials, risks, use of proceeds.  \n3. **Roadshow** – management pitches to institutional investors.  \n4. Price range set; underwriters allocate shares.  \n5. Shares debut; trading begins on the exchange.  \n6. **Lock-up period** (90–180 days) restricts insiders from selling en masse.\n\n#### Why IPOs are often under-priced\nBanks aim for a successful first-day market; a 10–20 % “pop” rewards early buyers but leaves cash on the table for the company.\n\n#### Alternatives to traditional IPO\n• **Direct listing** – skips underwriters; price set purely by market.  \n• **SPAC merger** – go public via a shell company.  \n• **Crowd-funded IPO** – sell small blocks to retail investors pre-listing.\n\n#### Activity\nDownload any recent S-1 filing (e.g., Airbnb 2020) and highlight: revenue growth, net loss, and stated “use of proceeds.”\n\n#### Takeaway\nAn IPO is a pivotal publicity and fundraising event—not an automatic bargain. Always read the prospectus."
